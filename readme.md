# Filecash economic model proposal

Since May 2020, the community has criticized the Juan team’s economic model design，The main arguments focus on the following two points:
- 1. The pre-mortgage amount is too high.
- 2. The penalty for sector failure is too severe.
- 3. The sector recovery cost is too high.

Filecash as Filecoin's first fork coin, Now launch the Filecash community’s first comprehensive Proposals for economic models with rewards in the form of community discussion:
- 1. The pre-mortgage method is set as a dynamic model, and the mortgage upper limit is set.
- 2. Reduce the punishment after the disk sector is lost.
- 3. Reduce disk sector recovery expenses.

**detail:** Pre-mortgage fee calculation formula: Expected earnings in the next 20 days = disk sector pre-collateralized currency

**Sector failure penalty calculation formula:** 5 days expected return + 2.14 days expected return = penalty for a single windowpost failure, The maximum failure is 7 times, after 7 times, the sector will be terminated and a sector termination fee will be charged.
